# Pipeline changelog

Every pipeline upgrade bumps `VERSION` and adds an entry here, newest first.
The version is stamped into every render's `qa.json` (`pipeline_version`)
so any video can be traced to the exact code that built it.

## 2026.10.12.3 — 2026-10-12
- Story ordering rule change (user): most interesting/important story
  FIRST — supersedes the 2026-10-11 smallest-first crescendo rule.
  Headline hooks, story numbering (#1–#5), and deep dives all follow the
  same descending order; #1 is the story viewers most need to see.
  Implemented in the daily cron worker instructions (via cron.update +
  cron.view). Takes effect on the next scheduled run (2026-10-13 03:45 PT).

## 2026.10.12.2 — 2026-10-12
- A/V sync root-cause fix (render.py): no-loop clips (self-plug,
  analytical animations) played ONCE via `-t {dur}`, but ffmpeg's `-t`
  is a cap, not a pad — the self-plug clip (5.69s) ended 1.36s before
  its planned 7.02s shot, shifting EVERY later shot early so story
  visuals changed before the narrator finished the prior story (user
  report). The render now probes the clip and appends
  `tpad=stop_mode=clone` to hold the last frame to the planned
  duration. qa.py gained a backstop: every rendered shot segment must
  match its planned duration within 0.15s or the run fails.
- Narration voice: Kokoro `am_echo` (user pick from the 9 American male
  voice samples; was `af_sarah`). TTS fingerprint includes the voice,
  so all segments re-synthesize.

## 2026.10.12.1 — 2026-10-12
- Badge pill visibility fix (render.py): the story-number badge's dark pill
  was drawn at alpha-140 black — invisible on black backgrounds, so badges
  rendered as bare numbers. Pill is now a lifted dark gray (48,48,48,235)
  that reads as a pill on black.
- Hook pairs for person-less stories (visuals.py): `_build_hook_pairs`
  now builds a logo-only pair when a story has no person photo (previously
  skipped → hook fell back to a generic article screenshot). Dark logos are
  auto-inverted so they read on black.
- Pipeline versioning introduced: `pipeline/VERSION` + this changelog +
  version stamped into `qa.json`. Upgrade flow documented in the
  `pipeline-upgrade` skill; cron instructions reference it.
